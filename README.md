# About ME

Since I was little I was surrounded by technology. The first time when I learned how to use a computer was close to my 3 years old ðŸŒ±, an activity that influenced my passion for the Tech industry.

Electronics caught my attention when I was 13 years old, so I started an Electronics Technician throughout high school where I developed a sense of dedication and responsibility at a very young age.

Without having graduated yet, a company required my services as a Technician, a job where I discovered my passion for programming, so I resigned and started studying at the university.

After a year I took the challenge to Join Henry and dedicate myself 100% to web development once and for all, place where I met very passionate and dedicated people ðŸ‘¯. People from whom I could learn much more than I could on my own, which is why I discovered that teamwork and constant communication are one of the best characteristics that the Tech industry has.
